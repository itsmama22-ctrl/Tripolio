## Why a checklist matters for design-led travel

Design-forward stays come with limited room counts, high demand, and partner-only perks. Instead of juggling ten browser tabs, let Tripolio streamline the process. Use this checklist alongside the [Tripolio map](/map), your saved collections, and affiliate CTAs to secure the best rates while supporting the creators behind each stay.

## 1. Shortlist with intent

- **Filter smartly:** Start on the [Tripolio stays page](/list) and filter by vibe, region, or partner (Booking.com, Airbnb, Expedia, more).
- **Save your top three:** Tap “View details” on each stay and save it inside the Tripolio app so pins sync to your map.
- **Check design credentials:** Look for Tripolio notes on architecture, sustainability, and community impact.

## 2. Validate timing & pricing

- **Seasonal research:** When scrolling Tripolio detail pages, review high/low season tips in the description.
- **Alert yourself:** Use Tripolio’s weekly newsletter (toggle inside the [home hero](/#newsletter)) to get notified of rate drops.
- **Compare partners:** If a stay surfaces multiple affiliate CTAs, open each in a new tab and compare perks (breakfast, flexible cancellation, upgrade credits).

## 3. Lock in the essentials

- **Amenity cross-check:** Scroll to the amenities list on the stay page and note must-haves (Wi-Fi speed, family suites, wellness access).
- **Deposit rules:** Affiliate links open in a new tab—scan cancellation policies before paying.
- **Travel windows:** Pair with Tripolio guides like [How to Use Tripolio’s Map to Plan a 3-Day Urban Escape](/blog/tripolio-map-3-day-urban-escape) to align bookings with your itinerary.

## 4. Layer experiences & services

- **Map your days:** Use Tripolio’s Leaflet map to visualize saved stays plus OpenTripMap attractions. Drag pins to structure morning, afternoon, and evening blocks.
- **Add Tripolio perks:** Many stays include Tripolio-only extras (e.g., 
private tastings, community tours). Note them in your calendar along with confirmation numbers.
- **Coordinate transport:** Look for airport transfer, bike concierge, or adventure desk amenities highlighted on the stay card.

## 5. Confirm and share

- **Store confirmations:** After booking through the affiliate CTA, drop reservation numbers into your Tripolio collection notes so everything lives in one place.
- **Share itineraries:** Use the “Share map” button to send curated routes to travel buddies—perfect for coordinating check-ins or splitting rooms.
- **Leave feedback:** Post-trip, rate the stay in Tripolio so editors can keep the catalog sharp and transparent.

## Bonus: packing & etiquette snapshot

| Item | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| Compact power strip | Many design hotels hide outlets in furniture—bring your own hub. |
| Dress code note | Some partner restaurants expect smart casual—Tripolio detail pages call this out. |
| Sustainable amenities | Pack refillable toiletry bottles; Tripolio favors stays that minimize single-use plastic. |
