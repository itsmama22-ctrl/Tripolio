## Why the Tripolio map is your weekend secret weapon

City breaks succeed or fail based on how fast you can curate stays, experiences, and dining into one intuitive plan. Tripolio’s Leaflet-powered map connects saved stays, affiliate offers, and local attractions (including OpenTripMap data) in a single view. Here’s the exact flow we recommend for a Friday-to-Sunday escape.

## 1. Seed your stay shortlist

1. Open the [Tripolio stays listing](/list) and filter by **Hotels** or **Airbnb** depending on your vibe.
2. Save two to three options that match your budget and aesthetic. Each saved stay auto-pins to the map with affiliate CTAs attached.
3. Need inspo? Browse our latest guides like [Tripolio's Guide to Mindful Boutique Stays in Bali](/blog/mindful-bali-boutique-stays-2025) or [10 Design-Led European City Stays to Bookmark for 2025](/blog/2025-european-city-stays) to align your picks with design-forward experiences.

## 2. Layer activities with OpenTripMap data

- Toggle the **Attractions** layer to surface museums, galleries, and parklands within a 2 km radius.
- Click any pin to view Tripolio’s curated blurb plus affiliate partner info (where available).
- Want to stay agile? Drag and drop pins to reorganize your day and Tripolio will auto-update drive/walk times.

## 3. Build a three-day route

**Friday:** Arrival, check-in, sunset view + neighbourhood dinner. Use Tripolio’s “Evening” filter for wine bars and speakeasies.

**Saturday:** Morning market, headline museum, lunch, afternoon respite, evening show. Drop calendar notes directly from the map.

**Sunday:** Brunch, last-minute shopping, late checkout, airport transfer reminders.

> **Pro tip:** Keep the map open on your iOS app—Tripolio caches the tiles for offline use if you sync before leaving Wi-Fi.

## 4. Share and iterate with your crew

Tap the **Share Map** button to send your curated itinerary to friends. They can add suggestions, vote on stays, and highlight dietary-friendly restaurants.

## 5. Lock in bookings through affiliates

When you’re ready to book, use the call-to-action on each stay card to open the affiliate partner in a new tab. Tripolio earns a commission, you keep the same rate, and the map updates with confirmation details.

## Final checklist before takeoff

- ✅ Saved stays with backup options
- ✅ Pins for breakfast, coffee, and late-night bites
- ✅ Tickets reserved via partner sites
- ✅ Newsletter subscribed for next week’s drops

Short on time? Load your saved map, pack a weekender, and let Tripolio guide you from arrival gate to final nightcap. Weekend escapes have never felt this curated.
